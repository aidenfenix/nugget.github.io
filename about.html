                        <p>When coming up with something that I was interested in printing, my mind immediately jumped to organizational items for my room. With this broad idea in mind, I began thinking of potential items that I could 3D print and optimize to my own needs. At first, I thought of wire holders, a modular vanity tray, and a pencil holder. While I enjoy the simplicity of these items, I thought they were perfect as they are and not in need of additional attachments. I started thinking about two items for which I could never find the right place – my keys and my coins! As someone who cares deeply about organization and saving money (even if it's just to buy a small beverage!) something that addresses this problem was a no-brainer. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to put my coins where they are sorted properly for easy money counting. That's when the idea came to me. Why don't I organize both of these miscellaneous items using one apparatus? </p>
                        <p></p>
                                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/brainstorm.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                            <h2 class="subheading">Planning</h2>
                        <p>When designing this, I needed to consider a way to hang a key from the apparatus without it getting in the way of the coin holder. The solution to this problem was simple: I would create a design that combines four hooks and a coin holder via a pole protruding from its center. Here is a sketch of my design:</p>

                            <h2 class="subheading">TinkerCAD and PrusaSlicer</h2>
                        <p>I found STL files for both a cylindrical coin holder and a hook, which I was able to open in TinkerCAD and combine by placing and extruding a cylindrical pole from the center of the coin holder. At the top of this cylindrical pole, I placed a cube so that the hooks have a place to sit. One challenge I faced, in the midst of this process, however, was that the protruding pole caused the print to extend beyond the print space. I took two approaches to fix this problem. The first approach was to shorten the length of the pole. The second approach involved trimming off the top portion of the print, which I determined would not affect the functionality of the apparatus. After making these alterations in TinkerCAD I was then able to open my stl file in Prusa Slicer. Because the hooks extend outward into open air, it was necessary to enable supports so that the printer could lay down filament in these areas. Additionally, I configured Prusa Slicer with specific settings to ensure optimal print quality. I chose a layer height of 0.2 mm, an infill percentage of 25%, and a moderate print speed to strike a balance between speed and quality. Lastly, I enabled a brim to improve bed adhesion and to prevent warping. After correcting this issue, I was then able to proceed with printing my design.</p> 

                        <p>Note: if you're curious about more detailed print settings, reference those of my kirby print under project 1. They are the same apart from infill, which in this case was increased to 25%</p>

                            <h2 class="subheading">Printing</h2>
                                <p>Printing went very well! I had some trouble at the beginning, since I assumed that the loaded filament in one of the Prusa Mini's was PLA, when it was actually a different material. I noticed this during recalibration when the filament was not extruding uniformally onto the metal plate. I quickly changed the material to PLA then tried recalibrating again and this time it extruded perfectly! Total time to print took approximately 22 hours.</p> 
                            <h2 class="subheading">Results</h2>
                        <p>Overall, the print came out looking very cool! In terms of structural integrity, the print was sound, although after removing the support material, I realized that one of the hooks had not been properly attached. Unfortunately, this meant that one of the hooks was not printed correctly on the side of the cube at the top of the pole. My efforts, however, were not completely in vain. 
                        </p>

                            <h2 class="subheading">Post Processing</h2>
                            At the end of the day, I still had three properly attached hooks and could correct my print by sanding the attachment sites of both the hook and the cube. I then proceeded by applying superglue to the detachment site, which would ensure a tight fit and help melt the PLA, creating a stronger bond. Here are some images of the sanding process:
                            <p></p>

<p>To improve my design, I think I'd have to extend the pole beyond its current length of about 7 inches. This would allow the keys to hang without interfering too much with the coin holder. To do this, it would require a 3D printer with a larger printing area than the Prusa Mini, which I believe I could reasonably gain access to after obtaining permission. Another aspect of the design that I would like to alter is the width of the hooks. As it currently stands, the hooks are slightly wide, meaning they can only support looped chains or strands with diameters larger than the width of the hooks themselves. The last thing I'd like to improve are the supports. I plan to use tree supports so that I use less filament, save time, and expedite post-processing</p>
                            <h2 class="subheading">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>As it currently stands, I do not think what I've printed is suitable for my keys. However, I believe it solves a problem I had not considered before! It can hold looped cables that are not in immediate use. Having this problem solved, as opposed to being able to hold my keys, is better since I have more miscellaneous cables than I do keychains</p>
<p>
In conclusion, my 3D printing project started with the aim of creating an innovative key and coin organizer. While I faced challenges during the design and printing phases, the end result showed promise, albeit with room for improvement. I've identified key enhancements, such as extending the pole's length and refining the hook design. Surprisingly, the apparatus proved effective for organizing miscellaneous cables. This project highlights the adaptability of 3D printing and has sparked new ideas for future endeavors.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Meet Nugget! - Project 6</h2>
 
<p>Nugget is a loving 4-year-old French bulldog, living in Chelsea Massachusetts
with her owner Catherine Paiva. Nugget’s name is a testament to her compact size and squishy nugget-like appearance. Nugget loves to play and go on walks with our two other Frenchies Biscuit and Chorizo, but also enjoys her alone time where she can nap and enjoy munching on her chew toys or treats. Unfortunately, Nugget was recently afflicted by paralysis in her hind legs due to IVDD initiated by unknown causes.</p> 
<p></p>
<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/nugget2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

<p></p>
<p>Nugget’s day is pretty standard for a dog. Nugget wakes up to go out for a walk and use the bathroom, eats her breakfast, enjoys some time by herself, then often gets up to play with Biscuit and Chorizo. While Nugget thoroughly enjoys playing and cuddling with the people around her, she’s also a big napper! It’s for this reason that Alex and I, heavily value her comfort in those moments where she chooses to rest. Unfortunately, Nugget’s current prosthetic is not suited to allow her to rest while it is on. When Nugget does attempt to rest with her prosthetic, however, she falls into a rather awkward and uncomfortable position as pictured here:</p>
<p></p>
<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/nugget.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
<p></p>
<p>Reaching out to our client was rather easy provided that my mother is Nugget’s owner. All that was necessary for me to do was to ask some clarifying questions regarding Nugget’s comfortableness in her current prosthetic, and what problems she’d want solved in Nugget’s ideal wheelchair. My prior knowledge, in addition to a quick phone-call over the phone, was sufficient in gathering the information we needed to move forward. Here are some established goals for this prosthesis:</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Wants prosthesis to be able to go on different terrains<p>
<p>• Efficient movement</p>
<p>• Legs do not drag on ground</p> 
<p>• Apparatus is set at appropriate height to accommodate for an attempt to use legs</p>
<p>• Turning (does not need to be sharp movement)</p>
<p>Other relevant information that I gathered or knew beforehand include:</p>
<p>• Her size: Nugget is a small french bulldog</p>
<p>• Her overall demeanor / behavior: calm and quiet</p> 
<p></p>
    <p>Our client was already equipped with a wheelchair that worked rather well. There was not much adjustment to be made in terms of its minimal requirements for its use as a wheelchair. However, of the few issues that did exist with her current prosthetic, the biggest problem was that one of her paws dragged slightly on the ground. Ultimately, this consideration will likely play a role in our final iteration of our wheelchair. Pictured here is a proposed solution to this problem:</p>
    <p></p>
<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/mod.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
<p></p>
    <p>In our discussion about what problem our modification should resolve, we formed an empathy map so that we could more easily identify which issues we wanted to address. Immediately following the formation of Nugget’s empathy map, a pattern began to emerge. We noticed that the issue that granted us the widest array options to explore (and with the moderate amounts of feasibility) was sleep. For the sake of progression, we decided to move forward with this problem, which would very quickly prove itself to be the correct choice.</p>
    <p>Our solution for the dragging foot problem and our primary hardware modification (which we will discuss later) will hopefully work hand-in-hand to promote Nugget’s comfort whenever she gets tired.</p>

    <p>After having made a phone call with the owner of our client, we set up a meeting for Friday November 3rd and discussed the logistics between ourselves and our professors before meeting. Our original plan for our Friday meeting was to use a scanner to record relevant measurements in the development of our wheelchair. </p>
    <p>Overall, our first meeting went rather well! Nugget was very behaved, although I should mention that our 1st attempt to scan her wheelchair was not entirely successful. At this point in the process, we were still unsure of what exactly we wanted our modification to focus around. Because of this, we weren’t exactly sure what we wanted to scan. Initially, we had thought that the wheel would be a good place to start, provided that one of our goals was to adjust our prosthetic for a variety of terrains. Additionally, the wheel was used to demonstrate the 3D scanners’ capabilities! We now have alternative considerations for the use of these 3D scanners, although we have their use reserved for a future date (this date is yet to be determined).</p>
    <p>The Scan and The Scanners:</p>

    <p>During our session with Nugget, one behavior that captured the attention of my partner and I was that Nugget would frequently get tired and attempt to rest in her wheelchair. Unfortunately, her current wheelchair is not accommodated to allow her to rest while it is equipped, so the position she’d fall into looked rather uncomfortable. Following this observation, our reservations about which issue to tackle was greatly reduced. This seemed to be the perfect issue to tackle.</p>
    <p>In our 1st and 2nd days of working on project 6, we discussed the idea of lowering the back of the wheelchair while maintaining a relatively even level with the front. To achieve this, we considered two options: </p>
    <p>adjusting the distance between the wheel pylons, involving a hinge mechanism</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>altering the length of the wheel pylons, which were already designed for manual adjustments.</p> 
    <p></p>
    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/white1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
    <p>Both of these strategies could be executed through a mechanical system of cables, pulleys, and/or springs that adjusted themselves depending on the wheelchair's angle, or alternatively, through a more electronics focused approach that utilizes cameras and motors to equalize the front and back ends' height. The downsides of any 4 of these methods were that they are rather complex and would increase the wheelchair's weight, to a point of undesirability for a dog of Nugget’s size.</p>
    <p></p>
    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/white2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
    <p>At the end of our session with Nugget (and further at the beginning of our next session) we discussed a new proposal characterized by its use of a pair of supportive props to keep the front of the wheelchair elevated while allowing Nugget to relax. Inspired by a human wearable chair (pictured below), the props would hang slightly above the ground while Nugget is standing, albeit without folding like the wearable chair would.</p>

    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/sitanywhere1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
    <p>Subsequently, we realized that incorporating the design of pinball plungers could enhance this mechanism by acting similarly to a suspension mechanism, therefore “cushioning” Nugget as she laid down.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Pinball Plunger Mechanism:</p>

    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/white5.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
    <p>Initially, we attempted to create a chart comparing the feasibility and impact of each solution. However, all of our proposed solutions were deemed equally impactful, leading us to rank the designs based on their feasibility. Ultimately, the front pair of supportive props plus the pinball plunger mechanism took the top spot in our Impact v. Feasibility chart.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Nugget's struggle with paralysis has inspired an intricate design process aimed at enhancing her comfort and mobility. Balancing practicality and innovation, our team's focus on Nugget's well-being highlights the profound bonds we share with our animal companions. Our pursuit for a solution, as depicted in the project's progression, reflects the power of empathy and ingenuity in addressing complex challenges. Our team meticulously iterated through various design concepts, leveraging feedback from Nugget's owner and our knowledge of engineering, to create a modified wheelchair that seamlessly accommodates Nugget's need for rest without compromising her mobility or comfort. We employed a systematic approach, exploring mechanical and electronic solutions, before settling on a unique combination of supportive props and a specially adapted pinball plunger mechanism, enhancing the design's feasibility and impact for Nugget's well-being.</p>
